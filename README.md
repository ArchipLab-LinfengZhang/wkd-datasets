# Wavelet Knowledge Distillation for Efficient I2IT
This repository provides the dataset and codes in our cvpr2022 paper - wavelet knowledge distillation.

## Dataset
We have conducted quantitative experiments on Horse to Zebra, Edges to Shoes and Cityscapes, and qualitative experiments on Winter to Summer, Apple to Orange, Photo to Monet and Facades. 

* **Horse to Zebra** is an unpaired dataset which aims to transform images of horses to zebras and vice versa. It is built on the images from ImageNet. It can be downloaded from [here.](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/cyclegan/datasets/horse2zebra.zip)
* **Edges to Shoes** is a paired dataset which aims to transform images of edges to natural images of shoes. It can be downloaded from [here.](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/pix2pix/datasets/edges2shoes.tar.gz)
* **Cityscapes** is firstly introduced as a segmentation & detection dataset. Following previous works, we use it in image-to-image translation tasks by reagrading the categories of different pixels as input, and the natural image as the output. It can be downloaded from [here.](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/pix2pix/datasets/cityscapes.tar.gz)
* **Winter to Summer** is an unpaired dataset which aims to translate images from photos from winter to summer. It can be downloaded from [here.](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/cyclegan/datasets/summer2winter_yosemite.zip)
* **Apple to Orange** is an unpaired dataset which aims to translate images from apples to oranges. It can be downloaded from [here.](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/cyclegan/datasets/apple2orange.zip)
* **Photo to Monet** is an unpaired dataset which aims to translate natural photos to drawings of Monet. It can be downloaded from [here.](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/cyclegan/datasets/monet2photo.zip)
* **Facades** is a paired dataset which aims to translate images from the semantic segmentation of buildings to its correpsonding natural images. It can be downloaded from [here.](http://efrosgans.eecs.berkeley.edu/pix2pix/datasets/facades.tar.gz).

## Codes
Our codes can be found in the supplementary material in CVPR website. Besides, we also provides the main implementation codes of wavelet transformation here.

```
from pytorch_wavelets import DWTForward, DWTInverse

class YourI2ITModel():
    def __init__(self):
        ...
        self.xfm = DWTForward(J=DWT_Level, mode='zero',wave=DWT_Basis).cuda()
        ...
    
    def get_wavelet_loss(self, student, teacher):
            student_l, student_h = self.xfm(student)
            teacher_l, teacher_h = self.xfm(teacher)
            loss = 0.0
            for index in range(len(student_h)):
                loss+= torch.nn.functional.l1_loss(teacher_h[index], student_h[index])
            return loss
```
